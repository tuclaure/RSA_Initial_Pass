Data Encryption Standard (DES) uses a series of bit exchanges and bitwise functions to encrypt data. The full-blown DES algorithm involves a lot of details; however, we will implement a much simplified version. As shown in Figure 1, the algorithm has multiple stages (iterations) of encoding. Each stage does the same operation but using a different key.  The more stages there are, the harder it will be to break the code.  A minimum of two stages are necessary for the code to be effective. Your implementation will use 8 stages.
